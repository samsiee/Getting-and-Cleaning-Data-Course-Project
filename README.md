#How to use the R-script
1. Download the R source code into your R working directory
2. Follow the R-script to generate a tidy data file: Load packages, download data, read all data frames, merge data, extract mean and standard deviation values and lable data. 
3. Run the final part of the script to create a .txt data file with only the mean value of each variable of activity
